### About the FBO App

 First things first: what is Fantasy Box Office, you ask? Essentially, at the beginning of the calendar year, we put together a list of all the movies coming out in that year. An auction is held, and you get $200 to spend on movies. However much those movies make domestically over the course of their run is added to your total. At the end of the year, whoever has the most in the bank, wins! Simple as that.

 This app is your one stop shop for all your FBO needs! You can sign up, join as many leagues as you want, and track the performance of your movies, compared to the others in your league. And on draft night, FBO provides a convenient platform to host the auction. With real-time bidding and easy ways to see your and your opponents' growing rosters, gone are the days of asking "who won that??" and "how much did you spend?". What's more, as soon as the draft ends, the results are automatically transferred to each user's dashboard, where users can immediately start tracking their lineup's performance!
